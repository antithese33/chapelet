# chapelet

A rosary recitation training app made in Python and using the pygame library.

For now, it only has basic Text-To-Speech, UI is barebones, only one voice,
it must be executed from the shell.

There is only five mysteries.

This is subject to change as I've got some time to work on it.

God bless
